# SPIN (Pre-)Workshop: Python & Obspy Crash Course

This repository contains material (notebooks and data) for the Python & Obspy crash course that will be held on 2021-11-18/19 as part of the SPIN [spin-itn.eu](https://spin-itn.eu) project.

**Part A (Python tips & tricks)**: The questionnaire has shown that all of you have at least some experience with Python. Therefore, I will not go over the **very** basics and will instead present a few helpful concepts, tips and tricks that you may not yet be aware of.

**Part B (Obspy)**: Some of you have experience with obspy, while others do not. I will present the basic ideas and data structures of obspy. Then we will download some data, and you'll have time to experiment with this yourself.

**What this course will not cover**: The basics of Python (how to define numbers, functions, etc. ). More advanced topics, such optimization of code for performance or parallelisation; code architecture; topics related to logistics, e.g., accessing and running code on a server; managing python environments

Some useful resources:

- [seismo-live.org](http://seismo-live.org/): Collection of jupyter notebooks on various seismological topics.
- [obspy documentation](https://docs.obspy.org): Obspy's documentation, including tutorials.
- [cartopy documentation](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/): Cartopy's documentation, including a gallery (very useful).
- MIT's ["Missing Semester"](https://www.youtube.com/c/MissingSemester): Introductory lectures on the logistics surrounding programming, such as terminals, code editors, git, debugging and profiling, and others.
